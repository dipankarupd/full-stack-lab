## React App

To create a react app, ensure the system has node installed.
To install node:
Just download node from nodejs.org

Use `npm create vite@latest` to create a react application. Follow the instructions they say in the terminal, and you will get the react app.

go into the application directory and then perform `npm i` followed by `npm run dev` to run the react application.

make all the changes in `src/App.jsx` and the changes there would be displayed

To run the app once you coded, use `npm run dev`

## Spring boot app

configure all your spring applications from `https://start.spring.io/` and download the zip file. Unzip it and start writing code inside of `src/main/java`
